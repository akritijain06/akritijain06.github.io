I am a Research Associate at Adobe Research in the Multimodal Content Experience Lab, where I work on making language models more reliable and efficient for document-centric applications. Before joining Adobe, I completed my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Roorkee, where I graduated with the highest academic standing in my department (GPA 9.35/10.00).

My research focuses on addressing bridging the calibration gap between model confidence and accuracy. I am particularly interested in uncertainty quantification and how it can be used to improve model outputs, particularly in multi-step reasoning and information-seeking tasks.
